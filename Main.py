# Define mock datasets

# Define global variables

# Define statistical functions

# Function that iterates through the datasets and finds correlations

# --- Main body of the program (genetic algorithm) ---

    # Take user input on number of assets to include and target correlation

    # Take variable number of assets and their historical prices

    # Compute statistical functions and find correlation of different combinations
    
    # Randomly combine different assets using random weights
    
    # Assess fit of correlation to within acceptable error of target
    
    # Discard lowest quartile and re-run algorithm if outside of bounds
    
    # Return resulting successful mix with proportions of assets
